**The internet is a haunted house, and I’m just here to rattle the chains.** As a digital nomad drifting through the Pacific Northwest—laptop, windsurf, and a healthy dose of paranoia in tow—I decided to build something that would make both red and blue teams sweat: [ReconBlitz](https://github.com/brigid-void/ReconBlitz). It’s an open-source, Rust-powered recon bundle trigger script, hardened for purple team CTFs and those deliciously adversarial spy-vs-spy games we all pretend aren’t just bug bounty with extra steps.

## **Why Another Recon Tool?**

Let’s be honest: the recon landscape is a graveyard of half-baked bash scripts and abandoned GitHub repos. Sure, there are some greats—reconftw, BigBountyRecon, the endless parade of GitHub dorks[2](https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw)[9](https://github.com/gaahrdner/starred/blob/master/README.md). But most tools are either:

* **A security nightmare** (hello, shell injection),
    
* **A performance dumpster fire** (Python, I’m looking at you),
    
* Or **a tangled mess of dependencies** that break the moment you `git pull`.
    

ReconBlitz is my answer to this: a toolset that’s fast, safe, and actually fun to use. No more “works on my machine,” no more accidental self-pwnage.

## **How I Built ReconBlitz (On the Road, No Less)**

* **Windsurf for AI-assisted dev:** Because if the machines are going to replace us, they can at least write my unit tests first.
    
* **DeepSeek R1:** Free, open-source AI model for code review, bug-hunting, and the occasional existential crisis.
    
* **Rust:** For when you want speed, safety, and the smug satisfaction of knowing your tool won’t segfault during a live demo.
    

All this, built on a battered ThinkPad in coffee shops and campgrounds—proving you don’t need a datacenter or a VC sugar daddy to ship something real.

## **Security Hardening: Not Just a Buzzword**

ReconBlitz isn’t just fast—it’s paranoid by design. Every subprocess is sandboxed. Output is sanitized. No more “accidentally” leaking your AWS keys to the world[7](https://www.firecompass.com/importance-of-github-reconnaissance-in-casm-cart/). It’s the kind of tool you can hand to a blue team without them immediately reaching for the incident response playbook.

* **Defense-in-depth:** Layered checks, minimal privileges, and zero trust for anything that smells like user input.
    
* **Audit-friendly:** Every action is logged, every result traceable. If you get owned, at least you’ll know how.
    
* **Modular triggers:** Bundle and trigger your favorite tools (SubFinder, Amass, nuclei, httpx, etc.) with a single command, but keep each isolated—because one tool’s bug shouldn’t be your problem[5](https://trickest.com/blog/recon-vulnerability-scanner/).
    

## **Purple Team Ready: CTFs and Beyond**

ReconBlitz was forged in the fires of CTFs and “spy-vs-spy” purple team exercises. It’s designed to let you pivot from passive recon to active probing in seconds, chaining together the best open-source tools without the usual dependency hell[5](https://trickest.com/blog/recon-vulnerability-scanner/)[2](https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw). Think of it as your own private automation army—minus the unionization complaints.

## **Open Source, Open Invitation**

The code is up, the issues are open, and the only thing missing is your pull request. Whether you’re a bug bounty hunter, a blue teamer looking to automate the boring stuff, or just someone who likes breaking things for fun—ReconBlitz is for you.

* **GitHub:** [ReconBlitz](https://github.com/brigid-void/ReconBlitz)
    

Let’s build the tools that will one day destroy the internet—ideally, by its own hand.

**TL;DR:**  
ReconBlitz is my latest experiment in recon automation: fast, secure, and built for the adversarial games we play. Developed on the road, hardened for purple teams, and open for all. Try it, break it, improve it—before the internet breaks us all.
