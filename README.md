## [brigid-void]

I navigate the messy intersection of [security], [automation], and [crypto payments].  
Semi-anonymous [pentester] & freelance dev fluent in [CLI] tooling, scripting up bots and recon workflows for [telegram], [discord], and the open web.  
If there’s a vulnerability to unearth or a tedious process to automate, odds are I’m writing a [rust] script, bot, or payload for it.

- Recent obsessions: subdomain enumeration, API hacking, and crypto payment automation (no KYC, ever).
- Experienced with self-hosted infrastructure, [systemd] service bots, and using [AI]/[LLM]-assisted enumeration on the daily.
- Writeups, disclosures, OPSEC-aware code, and [rust]/[python]-first exploits are welcome here.
- Sometimes build, often break, always document.

> I believe security work is about *never taking the digital surface at face value*—and that even the apocalypse has a command prompt.

**Open to:**
- [bug bounty] collabs
- lightweight [bot] contracts (Telegram, Discord, web)
- crypto payment gigs

[Reach out or fork a [workflow] just don’t expect me to romanticize the status quo.]
