# Hi, I’m ghosthermes (she/they) 👻

Welcome to the digital wreckage where I poke at the seams of the internet until it either breaks or reveals its secrets. A freelance hacker and journalist armed with Rust, bug bounties, and a healthy dose of technopessimism - but don’t mistake that for defeat. I believe in the optimism of the will: the stubborn hope that maybe, just maybe, the internet can be saved by its own tools before it burns itself down.

I spend my days hunting vulnerabilities in WordPress sites, wielding tools like gobuster, wpscan, and Metasploit like a digital archaeologist digging through layers of corporate negligence and sloppy code. When I’m not hacking, I’m writing - bug bounty writeups, vulnerability disclosures, and the occasional rant about how technological acceleration under capitalism is both our greatest weapon and our most glaring flaw.

If you’re here for Rust-powered subdomain enumeration tools or want to see how I port projects like Sublist3r and SubRuster, you’re in the right place. Pull up a chair, clone a repo, and maybe together we can watch the internet implode - or better yet, build something that outlives the chaos.
